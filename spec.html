                On this page, I will document the planned/actual functionality
                of my I-Day app, as well as specifying non-goals and providing justification / factors influencing these decisions

                <h2 id="goals-principles"> Goals / Guiding Principles </h2>

                <p>
                    My goal in this independent study is to develop a web/mobile hybrid app that can both ease and enhance the experience of the Career Fair, specifically the SWE iDay career fair that happens at Northwestern every October.
                </p>

                Reference to help me when designing and iterating on the UI and UX of this app:
                <ul>
                <li>Simplify the career fair experience by enabling the user to do everything a paper program could do - and more - through the app.</li>

                <li>Increase engagement before, during, and after the career fair through this app.</li>

                <li>Focus on the experience of the student first.</li>

                <li>Mobile = first, tablet = second, others = afterthought (priorities of smooth user interface experience)</li>
            </ul>

                <!-- experience goals, functionality goals, interface goals....? diff types of goals?

                    

                 -->
               
                <hr class="col-md-12">

                <h3> Technology decisions (some pending) </h3>

                <ul>

                <li>Realized the term for the type of app I want to make has a specific terminology and design pattern: Single Page Application (SPA).</li>

                <li>Despite researching the topic, I&#39;m having some difficulty <strong>distinguishing between what makes a web site vs. web app vs. hybrid app.</strong> I don&#39;t believe there&#39;s one &quot;true&quot; definition, but I am concerned about the ultimate <strong>ability to be downloaded and run from a phone offline,</strong> which requires being accepted to app stores, which requires functionality beyond that of &quot;just a web app&quot;, from what I understand.</li>

                <li>Decision between pure JavaScript, jQuery, and jQuery Mobile for functionality. Relevant concerns are built-in functionality (not reinventing the wheel) and [perceived] speed on a mobile device.</li>

                <li>Choice of HTML5 Mobile UI framework. Was concerned about using <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap 3</a> in that I read criticism it wasn&#39;t &quot;mobile-first&quot;, but as of today, Jan 30, I noticed the site has been revamped, and possibly some of the doucmentation as well. This will end up making my mind up about the jQuery issue if I stick with B3. My other consideration was <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/" target="_blank">Zurb&#39;s Foundation 5.</a></li>
            </ul>

                <hr class="col-md-12">

                <h3 id="current">Current I-Day Experience /
                Information</h3><em>Note: at a bare minimum, my app must offer
                all of this data, and if possible, improve upon each one. ...
                Anything that is in the paper handouts given to students would
                at least be covered in the mobile app, as the goal is to make
                the paper handouts eventually obsolete.</em>
