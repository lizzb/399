                provide progress updates in a format that can be viewed from
                any device, I will tentatively log my progress reports for my
                independent study (EECS 399, for interfaces depth) here.
                Although there is the drawback of not being able to directly
                comment on text body (such as in MS Word revision mode) I am
                making the prediction that my advisor on this project would
                prefer to read a website with organized headings, images, and
                links, rather than a verbose email or lengthy document.

                Week 4 - actual progress

                <ul>
                    <li>Established (well, formalized) a couple
                    <strong>goals</strong> to refer to to help me in designing
                    the UI/UX of this app:

                        <ul>
                            <li>Simplify the career fair experience by enabling
                            the user to do everything a paper program could do
                            - and more - through the app.</li>

                            <li>Increase engagement before, during, and after
                            the career fair through this app.</li>

                            <li>Mobile = first, tablet = second, others =
                            afterthought (priorities of smooth user interface
                            experience)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>Realized the term for the type of app I want to make
                    has a specific terminology and design pattern: Single Page
                    Application (SPA).</li>

                    <li>Despite researching the topic, I'm having some
                    difficulty <strong>distinguishing between what makes a web
                    site vs. web app vs. hybrid app.</strong> I don't believe
                    there's one "true" definition, but I am concerned about the
                    ultimate <strong>ability to be downloaded and run from a
                    phone offline,</strong> which requires being accepted to
                    app stores, which requires functionality beyond that of
                    "just a web app", from what I understand.</li>

                    <li>Wobbling between the <strong>decision of pure
                    JavaScript, jQuery, and jQuery Mobile for
                    functionality.</strong> Admittedly sunk too much time into
                    implementing a JS-only solution with help from list.js. My
                    <strong>main concern is speed</strong> (at least, as
                    perceived by the user), but again, this is another thing
                    that the internet argues about. Usually I'm not concerned
                    about optimizing speed, especially when dealing with a
                    small data set, but I could actually notice the laggyness
                    of jQuery Mobile demo apps on my laptop - therefore
                    clarifying the difference between jQuery, jQuery Mobile,
                    and JavaScript, will be helpful.</li>

                    <li> Data from SWE I-Day 13 appears, although it is pretty ugly right now. Manually had to copy and paste SWE i-day 13 materials in excel, but then used an online tool to export to JSON format. </li>

                    <li> Was concerned about using <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap 3</a> in that I read criticism it wasn't "mobile-first", but as of today, Jan 30, I noticed the site has been revamped, and possibly some of the doucmentation as well. This will end up making my mind up about the jQuery issue if I stick with B3. My other consideration was <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/" target="_blank">Zurb's Foundation 5.</a></li>

                    <li> In progress: programmatically creating all filters to maximize reusability and minimize chance of typos/bugs </li>
                </ul>
                <br>

                <h3> Overview </h3>

                <p>My goal in this study is to develop a mobile app that can
                both ease and enhance the experience of the Career Fair,
                specifically the SWE iDay career fair that happens at
                Northwestern every October. I was interested in this because I
                have personally attended this twice and it always pretty
                chaotic. I had hacked up a small scheduling tool for myself for
                my own purposes and just that experience gave myself more
                insight into what resources were lacking. Additionally, I have
                been to career fairs at the Grace Hopper conference for the
                last two years and those conferences were supported by
                conference apps. Additionally, I have been to the Google I/O
                conference, which was also supported by a conference app. So
                mobile event/conference apps have been really increasing in the
                past couple of years and is definitely an area of interest for
                me. I got a chance to explore this in a small bit this summer
                at a hack-a-thon at Google, but that has just whetted my
                appetite to explore this in more depth.</p>Click the button to
                reveal the full, verbose version of my current status. I have
                attempted to summarize it in bullet points below (specifically
                the feature spec section), but have not yet made a more concise
                version of all points:<br>
                <button class="btn btn-danger" data-target=
                "#week3report-verbose" data-toggle="collapse" type=
                "button">Reveal if you dare</button>

                <div class="collapse out" id="week3report-verbose">
                    <p>I think the ability to sort, search and filter companies
                    by location and by size of company is an important feature
                    of a job fair. Currently, what is provided is the name of
                    the company, what majors they are seeking, full time versus
                    internship and depth of education (undergraduate degree
                    versus doctorate). Also what would be desired to be
                    included is a categorization of the industry of the
                    company, the size of the company, locations they are hiring
                    for as well as miscellaneous information (such as a focus
                    on diversity).</p>

                    <p>I was curious whether Northwestern rewards long time
                    participants at the career fair for their support. So the
                    possibility to have QR codes for the employers to scan
                    students would be useful. When you log in, you would
                    register with your student ID and you would have a QR code
                    generated. Perhaps the recruiters could use this
                    information to see how many students stopped by their
                    booths. It would also be nice if it could convey student
                    information to the recruiter, although this might have
                    invasion of privacy issues that would need to be resolved.
                    Perhaps a student signing a waiver would be sufficient.</p>

                    <p>Pre-event engagement could definitely be improved. If
                    you had a profile, such as Career Cat or McCormick Connect
                    as well as Linked In (not provided by Northwestern), this
                    could be accessed. For example, at the Tech Expo, which was
                    yesterday, we got emails encouraging us to attend, but with
                    pre-registration this notification could be more targeted.
                    It would be great if this feature could be within the app,
                    perhaps reminding you to update your resume on line.
                    Although privacy issues would have to be sorted, the
                    students could choose which information they would want to
                    be made public, and the recruiters could sort by this
                    information to make their jobs easier as well. This might
                    help the recruiters connect a bit more. Many of these
                    conference apps have built in contact lists so that you can
                    create messaging features to meet up with people for dinner
                    for example, but that might be overkill for career day as
                    it is not long enough.</p>

                    <p>At Grace Hopper you upload your resume in advance and
                    sometimes booths will contact you in advance with a
                    reminder to ask that you visit. Pictures also can be
                    uploaded in advance. Uploading recruiter pictures is
                    especially helpful. For me, I have difficulty remembering
                    names and faces, so having pictures of the recruiters
                    allowed me to remember my interaction with them. Also, the
                    ability to have a platform to take notes would be helpful,
                    especially if a recruiter told you something specific, as
                    this minimizes the distraction of pens and papers and
                    allows you to focus on the brief time available for the
                    recruiter interaction.</p>

                    <p>It is reasonable now to assume that all student have
                    mobile devices and use them. On the company side, will they
                    have the same computer horsepower as students? I will have
                    to assume yes here. This app could also facilitate live
                    tweets or periodic notifications of how much time is left
                    until the fair is over. Many times at career fairs there is
                    not ready access to clocks and the long lines lend
                    themselves to keeping you off pace to accomplish what you
                    wanted.</p>

                    <p>An app can help you make a mental check list of what you
                    need before and after the career fair. It can prompt you
                    for whether an hour in advance whether you have your
                    resume, are you wearing the proper attire (such as closed
                    toed shoes), which would be a nice touch. What would be
                    desirable, although I am not sure now how it could be
                    incorporated into the app, is if there were a way to
                    identify what kind of student you were to the recruiter.
                    This would be like the electronic version of a colored
                    ribbon or name tag, so the recruiter could see students of
                    the desired major in the crowd, since each company knows
                    what majors it is looking for (but this is outside the
                    scope of my app).</p>

                    <p>Slogging through our u.northwestern.edu email is tedious
                    for devising a schedule, so an alternate way of doing this
                    and organizing your day and creating a map for yourself
                    would be desirable. If I were getting paid for this app, it
                    would focus on both sets of users, both recruiters and
                    students. However, as an unpaid project with limited scope,
                    I would choose to focus on the students, who with their
                    more tech savvy bent in general, are the more likely users
                    anyway. Also, there are more students visiting than there
                    are recruiters or planners, so the numbers would dictate
                    the first pass of developing this application aim for the
                    larger population.</p>

                    <p>What I believe is out of scope is the planning
                    experience for Ellen or SWE members and how to import data
                    easily for non-tech people. But I think I may have a method
                    for importing data from a previous project, so this might
                    be able to be added.</p>

                    <p>The app should also minimize internet usage. The app
                    should not always have to connect to the internet. In large
                    settings like Grace Hopper, massive internet use bogs down
                    the system locally. For this app, that may not be relevant
                    as it is a much smaller event. The Northwestern network in
                    Norris can likely support the number of attendees at these
                    types of events.</p>

                    <p>What is also out of scope is metrics of attendance or
                    ratings of specific booths. Even though this is possible,
                    and may have some prototyping, I did not intend to produce
                    the functionality to support this. This would be the same
                    for integration with Career Cat.</p>

                    <p>How else could this app improve the experience of the
                    Career Fair in ways are beyond a basic functionality. One
                    way would be line length checker. If you were about to head
                    to Facebook, it might be nice if it were full, to be able
                    to go to a shorter line with another company, but the
                    mechanics for that might not be possible.</p>

                    <p>The app should have the ability to star your favorite
                    companies. The app should also have a default searching
                    profile so that every time you go to a list of companies
                    you don’t continue to plug in the same search function.
                    Because the information is available on company names, the
                    list will be filterable, searchable and sortable. Each
                    listing will open up into a page featuring the company. It
                    will have their logo for identification, a link to the
                    company website, either a recruiting link or a generic
                    company link would be possible. The ability to filter by
                    job type and major will be part of the app, but not the way
                    that is currently done, which is an awkward excel
                    spreadsheet based format with every major listed followed
                    by X’s, which is visually difficult to use. Sorting
                    alphabetically ascending and descending and being able to
                    actively sort by table location ascending and descending
                    would allow the student to optimize their time spent at the
                    event. Sorting by room would also be part of the app.
                    Anything that is in the paper handouts given to students
                    would at least be covered in the mobile app, as the goal is
                    to make the paper handouts eventually obsolete. The app
                    will have to work on a number of devices, so I will have to
                    check emulators to make sure this is covered. Using QR
                    codes will require use of camera functionality, but that is
                    pretty much standard in mobile devices.</p>

                    <p>Week 2-3 - I made wireframes using Balsamic, looked into
                    current popular tools for wireframing and creating
                    interactive prototypes; realized that I was not the target
                    user of these tools; will be able to skip the prototyping
                    phase because I have skills to make a functional website
                    (whereas these tools are made for designers such as art
                    students without this experience); had some reaction
                    (negative) to use of <a href=
                    "http://builds.balsamiq.com/b/mockups-web-demo/" target=
                    "_blank">Balsamic</a> (seemed to be faster in power point);
                    need to investigate whether industry standard (use of a
                    specific tool) is more important than speed of development;
                    rediscovered tools from the Google I/O conference that are
                    specific for UX design for developers; these were helpful
                    but made me realize that doing design in a vacuum is
                    difficult, clashing with this being an independent study.
                    Therefore, will be cutting some design corners. Also
                    researched HTML5 and UI framework and native/mobile/hybrid
                    frameworks which are used in combination to allow in
                    develop in HTML, javascript and CSS. These allow one to
                    develop for the web but allow you to make external APIs
                    that can be put into app stores and downloadable to a
                    mobile phone platform without needing to use the internet,
                    eliminating the need for a robust internet connection. This
                    allows you to deploy to Android IOS, Windowsphone platform,
                    etc. while not having to develop new code each time. I
                    realized that there are a lot more options out there than I
                    thought there would be and spent some time trying to find
                    which would be best for me, but realized I need some
                    guidance. For now, I will stick to using web dev tools as
                    that will apply to almost any framework and is faster for
                    prototyping. Additionally, included in exploring these
                    frameworks was exploring different UI frameworks and while
                    I am vaguely familiar with responsive web page design
                    principles, I will likely utilize Bootstrap 3 to minimize
                    some of the testing efforts and making sure the page
                    displays correctly on a number of devices. I did debate
                    using Foundation but Bootstrap 3 will provide room for
                    growth as I am familiar with Bootstrap 2, but there are
                    newer features and also extensive on line community for
                    questions and in terms of a framework, whatever I use will
                    utilize JQuery mobile and although I have some reservations
                    in speed of programming with this tool, it is also robust
                    and has a wide community of users. Stress testing the
                    application is not a high priority for this assignment as
                    response time is not critical. I also determined some
                    things that were out of scope. Due to time constraints for
                    the project, I will focus on the experience of students at
                    the career and not including the organizers of the event. I
                    also recognized that some features I may prototype but not
                    actually make functional, such as logins.</p><!--

                    (upcoming) - I plan to provide the majority of the
                    information that was provided to attendees of IDay 2013.
                    This will be the basis of my app. This will include a list
                    of companies, what positions and majors they are seeking, a
                    static map of Norris and of the booths for IDay. The list
                    of companies will be sortable ascending and descending. I
                    will start on the filters but may not finish them until
                    Week 5. I will follow up with Ellen Worsdall to see if the
                    data I requested in Week 1 is available, which provides me
                    approximations of the user base. I am going to concretely
                    define my personas and scenarios or use cases and relook up
                    the terminology to see what is appropriate for this
                    project.
