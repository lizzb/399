                In an attempt to provide progress updates in a format that can be viewed from any device, I will tentatively log my progress reports for my independent study (EECS 399, for interfaces depth) here. Although there is the drawback of not being able to directly comment on text body (such as in MS Word revision mode) I am making the prediction that my advisor on this project would prefer to read a website with organized headings, images, and links, rather than a verbose email or lengthy document.
                
            
           
                <hr class="col-md-12">

                My goal in this study is to develop a mobile app that can both ease and enhance the experience of the Career Fair, specifically the SWE iDay career fair that happens at Northwestern every October.  I was interested in this because I have personally attended this twice and it always pretty chaotic.  I had hacked up a small scheduling tool for myself for my own purposes and just that experience gave myself more insight into what resources were lacking.  Additionally, I have been to career fairs at the Grace Hopper conference for the last two years and those conferences were supported by conference apps.  Additionally, I have been to the Google I/O conference, which was also supported by a conference app. So mobile event/conference apps have been really increasing in the past couple of years and is definitely an area of interest for me.  I got a chance to explore this in a small bit this summer at a hack-a-thon at Google, but that has just whetted my appetite to explore this in more depth.

                Week 1 - formulating the idea and identifying and contacting potential stakeholders; do some preliminary background research on the state of the apps in the market today

                <p>
                Week 2-3 - I made wireframes using Balsamic, looked into current popular tools for wireframing and creating interactive prototypes; realized that I was not the target user of these tools; will be able to skip the prototyping phase because I have skills to make a functional website (whereas these tools are made for designers such as art students without this experience); had some reaction (negative) to use of <a href="http://builds.balsamiq.com/b/mockups-web-demo/" target="_blank">Balsamic </a>(seemed to be faster in power point); need to investigate whether industry standard (use of a specific tool) is more important than speed of development; rediscovered tools from the Google I/O conference that are specific for UX design for developers; these were helpful but made me realize that doing design in a vacuum is difficult, clashing with this being an independent study. Therefore, will be cutting some design corners. Also researched HTML5 and UI framework and native/mobile/hybrid frameworks which are used in combination to allow in develop  in HTML, javascript and CSS. These allow one to develop for the web but allow you to make external APIs that can be put into app stores and downloadable to a mobile phone platform without needing to use the internet, eliminating the need for a robust internet connection. This allows you to deploy to Android IOS, Windowsphone platform, etc. while not having to develop new code each time. I realized that there are a lot more options out there than I thought there would be and spent some time trying to find which would be best for me, but realized I need some guidance. For now, I will stick to using web dev tools as that will apply to almost any framework and is faster for prototyping. Additionally, included in exploring these frameworks was exploring different UI frameworks and while I am vaguely familiar with responsive web page design principles, I will likely utilize Bootstrap 3 to minimize some of the testing efforts and making sure the page displays correctly on a number of devices. I did debate using Foundation but Bootstrap 3 will provide room for growth as I am familiar with Bootstrap 2, but there are newer features and also extensive on line community for questions and in terms of a framework, whatever I use will utilize JQuery mobile and although I have some reservations in speed of programming with this tool, it is also robust and has a wide community of users.  Stress testing the application is not a high priority for this assignment as response time is not critical. I also determined some things that were out of scope. Due to time constraints for the project, I will focus on the experience of students at the career and not including the organizers of the event. I also recognized that some features I may prototype but not actually make functional, such as logins.

            Week 4 (upcoming) - I plan to provide the majority of the information that was provided to attendees of IDay 2013.  This will be the basis of my app. This will include a list of companies, what positions and majors they are seeking, a static map of Norris and of the booths for IDay. The list of companies will be sortable ascending and descending.  I will start on the filters but may not finish them until Week 5. I will follow up with Ellen Worsdall to see if the data I requested in Week 1 is available, which provides me approximations of the user base. I am going to concretely define my personas and scenarios or use cases and relook up the terminology to see what is appropriate for this project.
